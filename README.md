MARSScreen
==========

An alternative homescreen for Firefox OS, with a MARS-feel...
Use with a good black-and-orange Mars landscape background for best effects.
Based on https://github.com/paulrouget/riverscreen

This is more a test than anything else, so don't ask me for features or anything, okay?
Just fork and adapt, it is not hard. There is no bookmark support, the bookmarks are added
manually in js/bookmarks.js. Adapt to your own. The icons are taken from awesome fonts, on
their site you can see which unicode character to use in style/theme.css

Here is what it looks like:
